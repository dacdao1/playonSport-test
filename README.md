Hi code reviewer, this is my submission to the coding challenge. Below are the instruction on how to run the code within your own environment. I also provided a link above where I went ahead and deploy my code base to netlify. Hope to hear from you soon.

## How to run the code

### Install Node.JS
Please make sure you already install Node.JS within your environment to run some of the commands below. If you haven't install Node.js within your system, then please click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once you have Node.JS within your current system, then you may clone this repository, or download it down through the download button on this page. When you complete downloading this repo, you may continue with the steps below.

### Install all dependencies and packages within

Use PowerShell or CMD to travel to the directory where you save this repo. Then please run the following command
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Once everything is install, please run the following command
```
npm run serve
```
Now the code is running in your local environment...Hurray!...please go to <localhost:8080> in your browser and test out my code. Please don't break the software, it is very sensitive....Have a good day.
